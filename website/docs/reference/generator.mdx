SwiftGraphQLCodegen exposes only one function - `generate` - that lets you fetch schema from a remote endpoint and get Swift code that SwiftGraphQL relies on to create queries.

#### `generate`

- `SwiftGraphQLCodegen`

Lets you generate the code based on a remote schema.

> I suggest you try to do most of the things with built-in CLI and only opt-in for the codegen when absolutely necessary.

```swift
let scalars: [String: String] = ["Date": "DateTime"]
let generator = GraphQLCodegen(scalars: config.scalars)

let code = try generator.generate(from: url)
```
