SwiftGraphQL is a lightweight client that you can use to fetch the data in an end-to-end typesafe manner and later process it internally to suit your needs.

> SwiftGraphQL intentionally doesn't implement any caching mechanism. This is only a query library and it does that very well. You should implement caching functionality yourself, but you probably don't need it in most cases.

### `send`

Lets you send your query to your server. It uses URLRequest internally and shared URLSession to perform the request, and returns Swift's Request type with the data.

You can pass in the dictionary of `headers` to implement authorization mechanism.

```swift
send(query, to: "http://localhost:4000") { result in
    if let data = try? result.get() {
        print(data)
    }
}
```

### `listen`

Lets you listen for subscription events coming from your server.

> ❗️ NOTE: You should handle the closing of sockets. SwiftGraphQL intentionally doesn't handle websocket state and only implements the decoding and sending mechanism.

```swift
// Start the event.
let task = listen(for: subscription, on: "ws://localhost:4000/graphql") { result in
    if let data = try? result.get() {
        print(data)
    }
}

// To close the socket.
task.close()
```
